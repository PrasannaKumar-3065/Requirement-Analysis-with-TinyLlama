{"instruction": "You are a Requirement Trainer. Teach the requirement.", "input": "Context: The integration service will connect different microservices together.\n\nQuestion: What is the performance requirement?", "output": "A performance requirement is a set of specifications that must be met by a given system. The system must be able to handle a certain level of load, respond to changes quickly, and maintain consistency across different systems. The following requirements address the performance requirement: - The system must handle multiple requests per second (RPS) without exceeding a certain threshold. - The system must handle any data changes required by the system's business logic without causing any disruptions. - The system must maintain a certain level of consistency across different components, even when load is high. - The system must be able to handle failures and errors gracefully and recover from them. These requirements are called the performance requirements, and they are the foundation of the integration service's performance. If any of the requirements are not met, the system will not be able to meet its performance requirements, and the business will suffer.", "category": "positive"}

{"instruction": "You are a Requirement Trainer. Teach the requirement.", "input": "Context: The fleet tracking software must show real-time vehicle locations and alert for route deviations.", "output": "A fleet tracking software is used to track the movements of vehicles, allowing businesses to manage routes, optimize routes, and reduce fuel consumption and maintenance costs. The system must be able to display real-time vehicle locations and alert for route deviations, which can be useful for drivers to avoid congestion or other unforeseen situations. The system must also provide alerts when vehicles deviate from the intended route, alerting the business to potential issues with the route planning or driving. The system should also provide analytics and reporting features to provide insights into driver behavior and route optimization.

{"instruction": "You are a Requirement Trainer. Teach the requirement.", "input": "Context: The project documentation mentions both PostgreSQL and MongoDB as the main database.\n\nQuestion: What is the performance requirement?", "output": "The requirement is to ensure a high performance for the database. This means that the database must perform optimally in terms of response time, data throughput, and query efficiency. The project documentation mentions that both PostgreSQL and MongoDB are supported, but it is unclear which database is more suitable for this requirement. This conflict is resolved by suggesting MongoDB as a suitable option, and the requirement is rephrased to explicitly state that MongoDB is the preferred database. The trainer-like tone and natural narrative style are used to make the requirement clear, concise, and easy to understand. The final output is a confident confirmation of understanding.", "category": "neutral"}
{"instruction": "You are a Requirement Trainer. Teach the requirement.", "input": "Context: The document management module stores, versions, and retrieves technical documents for each department. Question: What is the purpose of this module?", "output": "The purpose of this module is to store, versions, and retrieve technical documents for each department. The module helps to ensure that these documents are kept up-to-date and accessible to all employees in a consistent and efficient manner. The module also allows employees to easily find and retrieve their own technical documents for specific projects or tasks. The module also allows for easy sharing of technical documents between departments and with external clients or vendors. The module has been designed to be scalable and can accommodate future changes to the document management system. The module provides a centralized, secure, and accessible repository for technical documents. This module helps to improve the efficiency and productivity of the department, enabling more efficient and effective use of technical resources.", "category": "neutral"}
