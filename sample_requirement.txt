2. 24012 - CCM v4 - Disabled user notification
As per Christopher clarification point on 24Nov2019,
In CCMv4, created a complaint -> Accepted to user88 -> Disabled user88 -> Raised final review to user seven. Now, assigned admin user88 is still receiving mails even though it is a disabled user. 

I think that if an assigned user is deactivated then an email should go to the Complaint Administrators saying that a deactivated user is an assigned admin of one or more complaints and that they should reassign them to different assigned admins. This email should not go off if the deactivated user is in a group that is the assigned admin. If the user is deactivated then they should no longer receive emails 
Please check it.
As per mail from Christopher on 8-Apr-2020

The email should go to the Complaint Administrators and the Super Admin in the following cases:
1.Complaint has a single assigned user and that user is Disabled
2.Complaint is assigned to a group and all users in that group are disabled

Email text as follows:
Quote
{First Name} {Last Name}
This is to inform you that this complaint has had all its Assigned Users disabled by your Super Admin and should be reassigned to another user or another group of users. Its key details are:

No:                      CMT-11-000002
From:                  First Name & Last Name, Company 
About:                Product, Field 1, Field 2
Type:                   Black Snow
Severity:             2
Assigned:           Christopher Stainow (or if group list name of the Group)

Open the complaint and reassign it by clicking on the edit icon next to the Assigned To information.

19. 32430 - Customer issue - newsonheal19224, isotracker01219 -15Oct2021
Please note the following with demo account https://isotracker.biz/newsonheal19224/lennoxhill/:
    Date field that was added to Admin > Customers does not work as the calendar does not open – please fix. We changed it to a text box but it should be a Date field.

As per the chat discussion with Christopher as on 27Jul2021, need to do the below changes.
1. We will keep the 'Customers' (For example it's Top active one, it may be varying through drag and drop) as default selection at Setup -> Web Form. But, we will allow to deactivate it in Setup -> From/About.
Now, the top active option may be Suppliers (2nd option) in Setup -> From/About. Then 'Suppliers' will be selected automatically at Setup -> Web Form.
Hence, if 'Suppliers' is deactivated in Setup -> From/About, then 'Employees' (3rd option) will be selected automatically at Setup -> Web Form. Note that, order can be varying through drag and drop, so we need to follow the changed order.
Minimum one option should be 'Active' in Setup -> From/About.

I also had an issue when using Chrome with my account https://isotracker01219.lennoxhill.net/lennoxhill/index.php today for Non-Conformance NC-21-0040 in the CA Effectiveness section:

The text is not in its correct position using the Submit button – please fix
The Close text is also not laid out correctly – please fix

Please tell me when these issues are fixed.

20. 32180 - Customer Issues: itfits171117- 17Sept2021
Can you have a look at customer account https://itfits171117.lennoxhill.net/lennoxhill/index.php as I found it rather slow particularly opening the Customer list which while it has pagination was also very slow loading.

21. 32243 - Customer issue: itfits171117- 22Sept2021
I did notice that the Show Entries drop down did still exist in Supplies, Employees, Processes and Various. In Suppliers it is confusing as it displays 50 but there are 350 listed. I would suggest that this is fixed certainly when there are more than 50 in the list.

Finally I think that there should be pagination arrows at the bottom of the page the same as they are at the top of the page as it can be annoying to scroll down and then have to scroll back up to have to go to the next page.
